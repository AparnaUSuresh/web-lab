<ul><h3><u>Properties of css</h3></u>

<li>Display
Display takes on many different values, but only 4 are most commonly used.</li>
<li>Width and Height
    Width and height properties are used closely with display:block and display:inline to set the width and height of HTML elements while creating a website. 
    Common units units for Width and Height are:
</li>
<li>Margins are paddings are things that will definitely appear.
    Knowing how these things work will be extremely beneficial when writing CSS.

    Margins and Paddings dictate the spaces between elements on your website. 
    They are very similar and have the same units as Width and Height mentioned above.

    The only difference between margins and paddings is the area the exert control over. 
    Margins affect the area outside of borders whereas paddings affect areas inside the border.
    It is useful to refer to the box model below:
</li>
<li>Floats are one of the core elements in todayâ€™s website. 
    If you see two columns of text side by side, a sidebar / content configuration like what you see on my blog if your browser window is above 800px, 
    you have noticed floats in action. Another commonly used area for floats are navigation items.

    In the nutshell, what float simply does it to position the edge of the targeted HTML content at the edge of one side of the parent container. 
    Subsequent floats will then be placed at the edge of your first floated content. (depending on whether you float it left or right)
</li>
<li>Even though floats are immensely useful, they are sometimes a headache if they are not cleared properly.
    In general, 2 kinds of problems may occur:
</li>
<li>Fonts in general refer to the appearance of text in your website. There are a few things to look out for. 
    Like other properties, font has a shorthand. Do note that it is common to see the font shorthand declaration only once in the whole CSS file.
    It is common to use the different properties at other times:
</li>
</ul>
</div>
